                <p><strong>I. General rules for BOOKING tickets:</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>1. The booking of tickets for the Kino Arena cinemas requires electronic user registration. The personal data provided upon registration on the <a href="/">www.kinoarena.com</a> site is used in accordance with the Bulgarian laws. Cookies may be used for automatic user identification. 2. The booking of tickets or the email confirmation for such booking are not admission tickets by themselves. The cost of the tickets is paid at the box office of the cinema. 3. Online fee (booking fee) - the booking or buying a ticket online is provided at no extra cost for the moment. 4. Upon completion of the booking process the system automatically sends a confirmation to the email address provided by you with all the details (date, time, title, location, price) of the booked tickets as well as the unique booking number. 5. The booked tickets are paid at the box office of the selected Kino Arena cinema upon issuing the admission tickets. 6. The owner and/or the party providing any services via the website <a href="/">www.kinoarena.com</a>, as well as the operator of Kino Arena cinemas are not responsible for missed bookings and lost unique booking numbers.</p>
                <p>7. The seats selected in the booking cannot be changed at the box office of the selected Kino Arena cinema. 8. The cinema, day, time and title selected in the booking cannot be changed. 9. Validity of bookings: a. Your booking is valid and the tickets associated with it may be issued up to 15 minutes before the start of the selected show, then the system automatically cancels the booking. b. The cashier will accept your booking only if you tell your unique booking code and your names. 10. Booking limitations: a. If the names do not match the unique booking code the booking is cancelled. b. The maximum number of tickets of all types that can be booked in one booking is 6 tickets. c. After five (5) unused bookings the account of the user is deactivated automatically and the email address used for the registration cannot be used for reregistration. d. To avoid deactivation of an account, please use the 'cancel booking' option. e. The system does not allow more than one booking per day by the same user. f. The system may not accept your booking for the selected show and may direct you to select a different time or day. This occurs when over 50% of the seats are already booked. In this case the only way to buy tickets is at the box office of the cinema. 11. Booking implementation: a. For your convenience and for the convenience of the cashier we recommend you to print the email with the booking confirmation. b. The owner and/or the party providing any service via the site <a href="/">www.kinoarena.com</a>, as well as the operator of Kino Arena cinemas are not responsible for the implementation of reservations for which the client has submitted incorrect data.</p>

                <p><strong>II. General rules for BUYING tickets online and PAYING via the virtual POS in the www.kinoarena.com site:</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>1. The amount paid for an electronic ticket is nonrefundable with the exception of the cases of show canceling due to technical reasons or other force majeure. 2. The purchased electronic ticket cannot be changed, nor can the number of admission tickets included in it be reduced. 3. The electronic ticket is only valid for the cinema, title, day, hall and time selected by the user. 4. An electronic ticket can be revalidated only at the box office of the cinema up to 15 minutes before the start time of the show for which it is valid; the ticket can be revalidated only for a show with the same single ticket price as the single ticket price of the tickets included in the electronic ticket. 5. When selecting the types of tickets that user wishes to purchase, the latter is obliged to comply with the exhibition limitations of the selected film title - age rating under the Film Industry Law. If the holder of an electronic ticket is at an age, which falls within the restrictive exhibition visas of films, Kino Arena cinema has the right to refuse the holder access to the show. In this case the electronic ticket can be revalidated for a movie title of the holder's choice provided that the chosen movie title has no age restrictions and the admission ticket is at the same price.</p>
                <p>6. When buying a ticket at a discount, the user has the obligation to present the Kino Arena officials with a document certifying the user's right to use the discount. Failure to provide such a document is a sufficient reason for Kino Arena to refuse the user access to the show. 7. In any confirmed case of fraud attempt the electronic ticket is invalid. 8. In case the user has not printed the electronic ticket received via email, the ticket can be printed at the box office but only if the user presents the unique transaction number and an identity document. 9.

In case of discrepancy in the number of tickets, only single admission tickets that have been paid and registered in the system for online sales are valid and only the number of persons with paid admission tickets are allowed in the cinema hall. 10. Complaints regarding the quality of service provided (the film exhibition) are accepted only during the duration of the show. Kino Arena is not responsible for the artistic value and the content of the exhibited movies. 11. The electronic ticket is invalid if part of it is lost, changed or destroyed. 12. Online fee (booking fee) - the booking or buying a ticket online is provided at no extra cost for the moment.</p>
